# #JavaScript30

This repo houses my progress for [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com)’ [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course! Exercises that I feel are substantial or interesting enough are in their own repo and the rest are in here! Some exercises feed into my [100 JavaScript Projects](https://skullface.github.com/100-javascript-projects) Ⓟ尺ⓞ🅹e𝖈𝖙 𝓅𝓇𝑜𝒿𝑒𝒸𝓉 pro͈je̟ͅc̱̙̜̼̳͇̟͎̪̩ͅt̤̣̖̤̘̲͍͇͎̻̱̻– - - —

### Contributions
Hey, thanks for thinking about helping me learn!! I try to keep reflections and future to-dos in the readmes of each exercise. As the point is to _learn_ JavaScript and not create fully functional minisites, I’m dramatically limiting my focus on styling, accessibility, device/browser compatibility, and CSS structure in these exercises — no need to report bugs regarding those. If you have a code suggestion or something else that fits in a PR, I’m curious to hear more! Please remember to be kind; I’m learning as I go. 💖
