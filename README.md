This repo houses progress for [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos! Exercises that I feel are substantial or interesting enough are in their own repo. This rest are in here!

### Contributions
Hey, thanks for thinking about helping me learn!! I try to keep reflections and future to-dos in the readmes of each exercise. As the point is to _learn_ JavaScript and not create fully functional minisites, I’m dramatically limiting my focus on styling, accessibility, device/browser compatibility, and CSS structure in these exercises — no need to report bugs regarding those. If you have a code suggestion or something else that fits in a PR, I’m curious to hear more! Please remember to be kind; I’m learning as I go. 💖
